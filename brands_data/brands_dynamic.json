The popularity of remote work, flexible working schedules and the shifted nature of work have Round Multipurpose High Table Architonic ID: 20793301Year of Launch: 2024Modern offices and their spaces are constantly evolving. The popularity of remote work, flexible working schedules and the shifted nature of work have influence in shaping the modern office. The line between spaces for different functions – individual work, meetings and relaxation – in the same place is blurring. This requires offices to be increasingly flexible and mobile. Workplaces need to keep up with the dynamic way of working, providing employees with spaces that can quickly adapt to different tasks, spontaneous meetings and collaboration.These changes are also reflected in the design trends of modern office furniture.

Architonic ID: 20327583Year of Launch: 2021Meet the Drage family, bringing energy and dynamism to waiting areas, with their organic forms which render their modest and refined design timeless. Distinguished with their modest design, the Drage family supports the creation of a holistic and balanced perception of space, while its coffee tables stand out with their circular forms, enabling possible matches specific to the language of aesthetics and the needs of use of wherever they are, thanks to their three different heights and widths, their options of marble or sheet metal surface, and colour alternatives.Easily capable to harmonize with the pouffes that are other members of the Drage Family or with different modern designs, the coffee tables create dynamic areas of experience while their ways of installation can be constantly updated thanks to their flexibility of single or multiple use. Turning in every space into an element of balance with their circular form, the Drage pouffes with their modest style exercise an effect on the waiting rooms of hotels, offices, schools and hospitals, while they make the space less ordinary by allowing the creation of numerous combinations with their colour and material alternatives in the chart.DRAGE LOW TABLE- ROUNDØ48X52H / Ø68X42H / Ø88X42H Architonic ID: 20327583Year of Launch: 2021 Archit",

Architonic ID: 20327584Year of Launch: 2021Meet the Drage family, bringing energy and dynamism to waiting areas, with their organic forms which render their modest and refined design timeless. Distinguished with their modest design, the Drage family supports the creation of a holistic and balanced perception of space, while its coffee tables stand out with their circular forms, enabling possible matches specific to the language of aesthetics and the needs of use of wherever they are, thanks to their three different heights and widths, their options of marble or sheet metal surface, and colour alternatives.Easily capable to harmonize with the pouffes that are other members of the Drage Family or with different modern designs, the coffee tables create dynamic areas of experience while their ways of installation can be constantly updated thanks to their flexibility of single or multiple use. Turning in every space into an element of balance with their circular form, the Drage pouffes with their modest style exercise an effect on the waiting rooms of hotels, offices, schools and hospitals, while they make the space less ordinary by allowing the creation of numerous combinations with their colour and material alternatives in the chart.DRAGE LOW TABLE- ROUNDØ48X52H / Ø68X42H / Ø88X42H Architonic ID: 20327584Year of Launch: 2021 Archit",

Deriving its Architonic ID: 20325541Year of Launch: 2025Metric stands out with the dynamic silhouette of its vertical carriers at different heights and the vibrant rhythm it adds to the space. Deriving its uniqueness from the geometry created by the play of color and form, Metric determines the character of the space it occupies as an innovative seating product. The high and low backrest surfaces are treated as both a carrier and an element that creates the rhythm of the extraordinary aesthetics of the design. Fixed back cushions are part of the design and maximize comfort. Its structure, open to modulation options, allows for customization and space-specific placement. In addition to different color and fabric combinations, the optional neolith, lacquered, natural veneer, or marble coffee table option increases its functionality. As an original design that attracts attention in different spaces such as offices, hotels, lobbies, waiting and reception areas where it can be harmoniously placed, it offers not only seating but also interaction. Metric stands out with its unique aesthetics, quality, and durability while offering a comfortable sitting experience with CNC-cut cold foam HR sponge and sensitive lamination applications used in the backrest.

Deriving its Architonic ID: 20325541Year of Launch: 2025Metric stands out with the dynamic silhouette of its vertical carriers at different heights and the vibrant rhythm it adds to the space. Deriving its uniqueness from the geometry created by the play of color and form, Metric determines the character of the space it occupies as an innovative seating product. The high and low backrest surfaces are treated as both a carrier and an element that creates the rhythm of the extraordinary aesthetics of the design. Fixed back cushions are part of the design and maximize comfort. Its structure, open to modulation options, allows for customization and space-specific placement. In addition to different color and fabric combinations, the optional neolith, lacquered, natural veneer, or marble coffee table option increases its functionality. As an original design that attracts attention in different spaces such as offices, hotels, lobbies, waiting and reception areas where it can be harmoniously placed, it offers not only seating but also interaction. Metric stands out with its unique aesthetics, quality, and durability while offering a comfortable sitting experience with CNC-cut cold foam HR sponge and sensitive lamination applications used in the backrest.
