By incorporating this healthy movement into your day, you’ll find that you feel more present and engaged in your work.With its small size and high quality durable materials, Gravity also makes a great grab-and-go stool for impromptu meetings, and is an affordable choice for extra seating or furnishing your collaborative workspaces.Gravity works with all heights, features an eco-polyester cushion providing the right level of firm support, comes in various color combinations, and has the solid makings of a stool that will stay with you for years.

Sitting at an angle closer to 120-degrees opens your hips, improving both your posture and your circulation.Gravity’s slip-resistant rubberized base keeps you stable while giving your body the freedom to make the micro-adjustments it needs to keep on task. By incorporating this healthy movement into your day, you’ll find that you feel more present and engaged in your work.With its small size and high quality durable materials, Gravity also makes a great grab-and-go stool for impromptu meetings, and is an affordable choice for extra seating or furnishing your collaborative workspaces.Gravity works with all heights, features an eco-polyester cushion providing the right level of firm support, comes in various color combinations, and has the solid makings of a stool that will stay with you for years.
