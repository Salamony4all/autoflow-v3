Alek armchair series offer a simple naturalness with its oval-shaped wooden frame.Alek invites you to a comfortable seating experience. Its armrests and back are designed as a single structure. The cylindrical wooden legs extend diagonally from the armrest level to the ground, bringing an aesthetical contrast to the oval formed backrest. The warmth of wood dominates the visual impact as it unifies with a smooth cushion seat. 70 mm thick soft foam seat and the fresh look of wood reinforce the feeling of comfort.The wooden frame of Alek armchair comes in ash, walnut and black solid wood finishes as presented in the B&T Design’s solid wood catalogue. The seat and backrest are also customisable with a rich collection of fabrics that offer different textures and colours that would suit best with the characteristics of the space.ALEK LOUNGEWidth (cm) 73.5Depth (cm) 64.5Height (cm) 64.5Seat depth (cm) 58Seat height (cm) 41Arm height (cm) 56 Architonic ID: 20327557Year of Launch: 2020 Architonic ID: 20327557 One of the nature’s strongest textures, wood comes to light as a brand new design.

Deriving its uniqueness from the geometry created by the play of color and form, Metric determines the character of the space it occupies as an innovative seating product. The high and low backrest surfaces are treated as both a carrier and an element that creates the rhythm of the extraordinary aesthetics of the design. Fixed back cushions are part of the design and maximize comfort. Its structure, open to modulation options, allows for customization and space-specific placement. In addition to different color and fabric combinations, the optional neolith, lacquered, natural veneer, or marble coffee table option increases its functionality. As an original design that attracts attention in different spaces such as offices, hotels, lobbies, waiting and reception areas where it can be harmoniously placed, it offers not only seating but also interaction. Metric stands out with its unique aesthetics, quality, and durability while offering a comfortable sitting experience with CNC-cut cold foam HR sponge and sensitive lamination applications used in the backrest.

They create a ground for the play of light, offer an impressive aesthetic of the integration of form with space, and emphasize comfort!Bearing the signature of Japanese designer Jin Kuramoto for B&T, QUAD and TRI, two members of the Pod family, are designed as seating products that reshape geometric forms with a simple and strong aesthetic, bringing a unique visual appeal to spaces they inhabit. Formed by the cutting and bending of materials from everyday life and transforming two basic geometric forms- the triangle and the square- the Pod family features a cylindrical structure that allows light to flow across the fabric, becoming a defining element of the space’s atmosphere. With minimalist lines, the Pod family adapts and transforms the area it occupies. In spacious interiors with high ceilings, it creates a bold and playful effect through multiple arrangements, while in smaller spaces like exhibition areas, it becomes a captivating focal point.

Architonic ID: 20327583Year of Launch: 2021Meet the Drage family, bringing energy and dynamism to waiting areas, with their organic forms which render their modest and refined design timeless. Distinguished with their modest design, the Drage family supports the creation of a holistic and balanced perception of space, while its coffee tables stand out with their circular forms, enabling possible matches specific to the language of aesthetics and the needs of use of wherever they are, thanks to their three different heights and widths, their options of marble or sheet metal surface, and colour alternatives.Easily capable to harmonize with the pouffes that are other members of the Drage Family or with different modern designs, the coffee tables create dynamic areas of experience while their ways of installation can be constantly updated thanks to their flexibility of single or multiple use. Turning in every space into an element of balance with their circular form, the Drage pouffes with their modest style exercise an effect on the waiting rooms of hotels, offices, schools and hospitals, while they make the space less ordinary by allowing the creation of numerous combinations with their colour and material alternatives in the chart.DRAGE LOW TABLE- ROUNDØ48X52H / Ø68X42H / Ø88X42H Architonic ID: 20327583Year of Launch: 2021 Archit",

Architonic ID: 20327584Year of Launch: 2021Meet the Drage family, bringing energy and dynamism to waiting areas, with their organic forms which render their modest and refined design timeless. Distinguished with their modest design, the Drage family supports the creation of a holistic and balanced perception of space, while its coffee tables stand out with their circular forms, enabling possible matches specific to the language of aesthetics and the needs of use of wherever they are, thanks to their three different heights and widths, their options of marble or sheet metal surface, and colour alternatives.Easily capable to harmonize with the pouffes that are other members of the Drage Family or with different modern designs, the coffee tables create dynamic areas of experience while their ways of installation can be constantly updated thanks to their flexibility of single or multiple use. Turning in every space into an element of balance with their circular form, the Drage pouffes with their modest style exercise an effect on the waiting rooms of hotels, offices, schools and hospitals, while they make the space less ordinary by allowing the creation of numerous combinations with their colour and material alternatives in the chart.DRAGE LOW TABLE- ROUNDØ48X52H / Ø68X42H / Ø88X42H Architonic ID: 20327584Year of Launch: 2021 Archit",

Deriving its Architonic ID: 20325541Year of Launch: 2025Metric stands out with the dynamic silhouette of its vertical carriers at different heights and the vibrant rhythm it adds to the space. Deriving its uniqueness from the geometry created by the play of color and form, Metric determines the character of the space it occupies as an innovative seating product. The high and low backrest surfaces are treated as both a carrier and an element that creates the rhythm of the extraordinary aesthetics of the design. Fixed back cushions are part of the design and maximize comfort. Its structure, open to modulation options, allows for customization and space-specific placement. In addition to different color and fabric combinations, the optional neolith, lacquered, natural veneer, or marble coffee table option increases its functionality. As an original design that attracts attention in different spaces such as offices, hotels, lobbies, waiting and reception areas where it can be harmoniously placed, it offers not only seating but also interaction. Metric stands out with its unique aesthetics, quality, and durability while offering a comfortable sitting experience with CNC-cut cold foam HR sponge and sensitive lamination applications used in the backrest.

They create a ground for the play of light, offer an impressive aesthetic of the integration of form with space, and emphasize comfort!Bearing the signature of Japanese designer Jin Kuramoto for B&T, QUAD and TRI, two members of the Pod family, are designed as seating products that reshape geometric forms with a simple and strong aesthetic, bringing a unique visual appeal to spaces they inhabit.
